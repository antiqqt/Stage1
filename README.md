## My projects from RS School stage#1
These are some advanced projects I made during [RS School](https://rollingscopes.com/) [stage#1](https://rs.school/js/) course in 2022.

1. [Shelter landing page](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/antiqqt-JSFE2022Q1/shelter/pages/main/)
> *2 responsive and interactive landing pages with slider, popup, hamburger menu and pagination elements.*
- The layout is adaptive and responsive.
- On all screenwidths layout looks exactly like the mockup in Figma. Checked with Perfect Pixel extension in Google Chrome.
- None of the resolutions up to and including 320px have a horizontal scroll bar. The entire content of the page is preserved and not cut off or deleted.
- An adaptive menu is implemented on a screen width of 768px or less.
- Endless slider with random card generation on main page.
- Popup window with additional information opens when card is clicked on.
- Pseudo-random card generation in card gallery on second page.
- The navigation displays the number of the current page, allows user to flip to next or previous page or to the either end of the gallery.
